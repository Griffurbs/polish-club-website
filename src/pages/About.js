               The Polish Club at UT was established in January 2021 to provide a Polish community for UT students on campus. The club is a group of undergraduate and graduate UT students. Most club members are Polish, but some are not. Both Polish and non-Polish students are welcome to join the club. While some club members speak Polish, most do not.
                <br /><br />
                The mission of the Polish Club at UT is to bring students together to learn about Polish history, culture, politics, language, and more.
                <br /><br />
                The purpose of the Polish Club at UT is to expand knowledge of all-things Polish and to foster a strong connection between the Polish diaspora (Polonia) and Poland.
                <br /><br />
                The aims of the Polish Club at UT are to invite esteemed guest speakers; offer leadership opportunities; engage in Polish community events; embark upon Polish-themed outings/field trips; participate in Polish community service and fundraisers; host weekly, student-led Polish language circles; and cook Polish food together.
